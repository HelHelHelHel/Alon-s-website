                <p>At Gillies Aesthetic we take pride in helping our patients with a range of hair issues. Whether it is

                <p>By the time people enter their thirties, a significant amount of people will experience hair thinning
                    and hair loss. By the age of 35, around 40% of men will experience some hair loss. And for women, by
                    age 40, around 40% of them will also experience thinning hair and loss of hair.</p>

                <h5>Our hair treatments include:</h5> 
                <ul>
                    <li>PRP Therapy</li>
                    <li>Meshotherapy for hair-loss</li>
                    <li>Customized compounded formulations for hair loss</li>

                    their teens. Many people are also prone to acute hair loss due to sickness or simply stress. We are
                    here to help determine which course of treatment is best for your hair care needs.</p>

            <h5>Platelet Rich Plasma</h5>
            <p>PRP therapy is a form of regenerative medicine that’s based on evidence that our bodies can heal
                themselves when these powers are harnessed properly.
                The best part of this treatment is the fact that the medication is actually produced from your own
                body. Most people familiar with PRP know that it is traditionally used for the treatment for tendon
                and muscle injuries. But Platelet Rich Plasma is also a powerful tool for helping reduce hair loss
                and even reverse it. In the field of medical aesthetics, we can easily used PRP to thicken hair, and
                it even works with hair transplants. It is injected around hair follicles to make hair grow thicker
                and even activate follicles that have gone dormant and stopped producing hair.</p>

            <p>Platelets are cell fragments, also known as thrombocytes are a common component of blood, and work
                similar to white blood cells. Their primary function is blood clotting. When activated platelets
                also released many growth factors and other proteins critical to important processes such as cell
                division, tissue regeneration, and overall healing.</p>

            <p>PRP solutions can also be injected into the skin. Platelet Rich Plasma can help your own collagen to
                grow, and can regenerates tissue. This causes the skin to smooth and fill out, tightening lines and
                wrinkles. This procedure results in some of the most naturally smooth looking skin medical
                aesthetics procedures can provide.</p>

            <p>Platelet Rich Plasma is plasma that has a higher concentration of platelets than normal blood. PRP is
                formulated to contain increased concentrations of these factors commonly by 5 to 10. To make the PRP
                concentration we draw a small amount of blood from the patient. The blood is then concentrated using
                a centrifuge, and then the concentration is injected into hair follicle sites. Since PRP is taken
                from the patient’s own blood the risks associated with PRP injections are minimal.</p>

            <p>What happens once we inject these platelets? There are now millions of them in the blood,
                concentrated around the local injection site. The PRP solution starts the healing process, and
                causes stem cells to stimulate growth and healing. In addition, the plasma fluid provides the
                injected area with lots of minerals and vitamins which wont normally reach the scalp area at older
                ages due to reduced blood flow to that area. We only require a small amount of blood to get all the
                healing and growth factors you need.Smiling, smirking, frowning, and other expressions can etch
                wrinkles and lines into your face. Botox, and other wrinkle reducers such as Dysport® and Xeomin®,
                temporarily halt the muscle movements that cause dynamic wrinkles and lines to form on your face.

                <h5>So, Is PRP Effective for Hair Loss… For Certain?</h5>
                <p>There are a lot of components in our body and our blood that work in tandem in order to heal a
                    wound. There hasn’t been enough evidence to say it’s 100% a definite fact that platelets play an
                    outsize role in this process or that they alone contribute a significant effect in the healing
                    process.</p>

                <p>The claim that additional platelets stimulate growth and healing is therefore subject to debate.
                    However, using platelet rich plasma for hair loss has met with success in quite a number of
                    individuals who have experienced almost a full recovery from balding. As more people undergo the
                    procedure, we will get a much clearer picture of the PRP hair treatment success rate.</p>

                <h5>How Long Before You Can See Results?</h5>
                <p>As with any hair loss treatment (excluding transplantation), it takes months for the follicle to
                    strengthen and produce the visible results of a stronger healthier hair. The signs of new hair
                    growth can usually be seen 4-6 months after the PRP injections. The hair continues to become
                    stronger and thicker for up to 15 months after treatment, but continued PRP injections are
                    required to maintain the results and avoid regression of the hair growth.</p>
                <p>The results will occur with growth that is relative to your normal hair growth cycle. By the
                    12month mark, you will have a good indication of how successful your PRP hair treatment has
                    been.</p>
