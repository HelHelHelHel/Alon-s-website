            <h5>Platelet Rich Plasma</h5>
            <p>PRP therapy is a form of regenerative medicine that’s based on evidence that our bodies can heal themselves when these powers are harnessed properly. The best part of this treatment is the fact that the medication is actually produced from
                your own body. Most people familiar with PRP know that it is traditionally used for orthopedic treatments. However, Platelet Rich Plasma is also a powerful tool in helping reduce hair loss and even reverse it. In the field of medical aesthetics,
                we can easily use PRP to thicken hair, even after hair transplants. It is injected around hair follicles to make hair grow thicker and even activate follicles that have gone dormant and stopped producing hair.
            </p>

            <p>Platelets are cell fragments, a common component of blood. Their primary function is blood clotting. When activated platelets also released many growth factors and other proteins critical to important processes such as cell division, tissue
                regeneration, and overall healing.
            </p>

            <p>One of the additional uses of PRP are skin treatments. When injected into the skin, Plasma will help your own skin produce more collagen, growing and regenerating the tissue. This will cause your skin to smoothen, fill out, tighten and loss
                lines and wrinkles. This procedure will have some of the most natural, smooth looking skin results medical aesthetics can offer.
            </p>
            <h5>How is PRP made?
            </h5>
            <p>To make the PRP concentration we draw a small amount of blood from the patient. The blood is then concentrated using a centrifuge, and then the concentration is injected into scalp. Since PRP is taken from the patient’s own blood the risks
                associated with PRP injections are minimal.</p>
            <h5>What happens once we inject this plasma?
            </h5>
            <p>The PRP solution starts the healing process, and causes stem cells to stimulate growth and healing. In addition, the plasma fluid provides the injected area with lots of minerals and vitamins which wont normally reach the scalp area at older
                ages due to reduced blood flow to that area.
            </p>
